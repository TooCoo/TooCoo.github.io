					Aerial Additive Building Manufacturing (Aerial ABM) is a UK EPSRC funded research that will develop an aerial robotic construction system that enables aerial robots to 3D print building structures autonomously.  Additive Building Manufacturing (ABM), is already being trialled in many parts of the world by the construction industry. It involves the use of large robots on a building site that extrude building materials to construct buildings, similar to a 3D printer. This process has the advantage of reducing construction times, material and transport costs and easing traffic and environmental impacts. These technologies also have the potential to improve safety in the building industry. According to the International Labour Organisation, at least 60,000 people are killed every year on construction sites - around one death every 10 minutes. Current approaches to ABM are all ground-based, only operating in easily accessible locations, with limited ability to adapt to diverse site conditions. The research team aims to miniaturise ABM and provide it with aerial capabilities so that it can be more mobile, and able to manufacture complex building structures while adapting to diverse site scenarios. This miniaturisation will also enable parallel production, where swarms of aerial printers working together could potentially reduce construction times. The aerial robots would be able to fly above difficult ground conditions and land at a construction site where they could work together to construct a building from scratch. The research will enable safer construction in hard-to access and dangerous conditions often faced in construction work at-height and post-disaster reconstruction.
